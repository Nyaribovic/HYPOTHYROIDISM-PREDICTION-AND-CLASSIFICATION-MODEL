# HYPOTHYROIDISM-PREDICTION-AND-CLASSIFICATION-MODEL

# Purpose of the Repository

The aim of this project is to make use of Decision tree algorithm to predict the diagnosis of thyroid gland disease (hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism or a normal condition) via decision tree and SVM algorithms.The project will require the analyst to perform;
* Feature transformation and dimensionality reduction techniques so as to increase the quality of the feature space. 
* Compare multiple reggression and choose the one that performs bes


# Success Metrics
